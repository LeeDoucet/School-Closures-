# School Closures 
Investigating School Closures in Ontario

School Data has a list of all schools that have closed from the fall of 2011 to the spring of 2020. The original data is Data Sheets. 
Each year the list of Ontario schools were compared between the current year and the previous year.
Schools that did not appear on the current year were deemed closed, they were tracked by school number.
