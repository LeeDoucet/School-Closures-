# School Closures 

Investigating School Closures in Ontario

Data from the Ontario provinical government is inside Data Sheets and lists all schools each year from the academic school yeaer 2011-2012 until the academic school year 2019-2020

A custom dataset was made using Excel with the Ontario provinical government data that compared each school year to determine which ones had closed. That file is SchoolData2.xlsx. It lists all schools from the 2019-2020 school year as "Open" and all schools from 2011-2012 to the present that did make it on the 2019-2020 list as "Closed"
